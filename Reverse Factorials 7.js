// I'm sure you're familiar with factorials â€“ that is, the product of an integer and all the integers below it.

// For example, 5! = 120, as 5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 = 120

// Your challenge is to create a function that takes any number and returns the number that it is a factorial of. So, if your function receives 120, it should return "5!" (as a string).

// Of course, not every number is a factorial of another. In this case, your function would return "None" (as a string).

// Examples
// 120 will return "5!"
// 24 will return "4!"
// 150 will return "None"
